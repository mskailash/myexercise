--------------
1. m_duplicates_in_dir.py - Contains processing variables and methods

MODULE INFO:
-----------
scan_duplicates.py, in Python, which takes a directory as its argument, scans all filenames beneath that
directory (including subdirectories), and suggests which filenames are redundant and could be deleted, in the
following format (one per line).

./<PATH>/<File1> may be superseded by ./<PATH>/<File2>

1. The Main Program s_scan_duplicates.py, reads the directory name command line argument [ With an option to Debug ]
   and uses members of module m_duplicates_in_dir.py to validate the filenames.

2. Under the module m_duplicates_in_dir.py, duplicates_in_dir Class contains following members:
	a. Directory name: Name of the directory to be scanned
	b. File-List: List of Readable files in the directory (including the subdirectories)
	c. File_count: has the count of readable files in the directory (including the subdirectories)
   and a Function to Identify Duplicate file names (Excluding file extensions)


	
ASSUMPTIONS:
-----------
1. Files – for simplicity all scanned files are regular ones.

2. File-Name – The spec does not require the content of files to be compared.

3. Links – Skip, or for simplicity you can assume no soft links.

4. Permission – Skip unreadable files, or for simplicity you can assume no access restrictions.

5. Establishing Original File - If there are 3 copies of the same file, there must be 3 lines printed. Where the rules about which file should be considered “latest” are ambiguous, you are free to use your own judgement.

6. Hidden files - are not handled as they have conflict with the requirements.
